# Pokemon-stat-comparison
A group class project done in April 2022. This program compares pokemon statistics such as speed, health, attacck, defense, weight, type distribution. This program uses the first 4 generation of pokemon for comparison and it shows data such as mean, variance, and standard deviation of the health, attack, and defense statisttics of the pokemon. Graphs are also used to represent some data comparison, pie, bar, and horizontal bar graphs are used.

The program reads a csv file to retrieve the pokedex data and that is cleaned and sorted into a dataframe. The mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of few stat types are calculated. Afterwards, Graph comparisons are shown comparing speed using a line plot, types in comparison to health/attack using a bar graph, weight using a histogram, and type distribution using pie charts. Conclusions of the graph data are represented at the end of the program.

Libraries used: matplotlib, NumPy, pandas

 A group project in itself can be a challenge, but some other challenged faced was the Pie chart, it was the hardest graph to implement. There were constant visual errors such as the percentage not sized correctly, only one pie graph would show instead of 4, labels not showing, etc.
